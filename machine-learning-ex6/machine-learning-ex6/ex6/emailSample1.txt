Dear all,

You're receiving this email because you signed up for "Investigating Cooperative Partnerships" last semester. If you're available this Tuesday afternoon AND have not done the study before (it's the study where you have to count dots on a computer screen), please sign up at the link below. You'll be paid $5 for half an hour and on top of that another $1-4 depending on your performance.

Have a great semester ahead.

Best,
